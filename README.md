# IZEA Exercise

Convert desktop and mobile PSDs into HTML5 Responsive page

## Requirements

* Do not use a front end framework such as bootstrap.
* You can choose to either include the filler text as written, or provide your own.
* Use the images provided in the assets directory where applicable.
* The page should be responsive rather than have a separate mobile version.
* Aside from the provided images, no other images should be used in the creation of your page.
* If you do not have access to the Helvetica font, you may substitute with a sans-serif of your choosing.
* Hover state for navigation links should use the same style as their active state (As represented in mock images).
* Visited state for navigation links should use the same style as their inactive state (As represented in mock images).

## Bonus

Instead of hiding the navigation menu on mobile devices, adapt it into a mobile-friendly interface of your design. You may use JavaScript to achieve your desired results.

## Production Notes

* Used [Todd Motto's FireShell](http://github.com/toddmotto/fireshell) to automate the build process
